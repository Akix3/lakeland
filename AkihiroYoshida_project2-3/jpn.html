						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Edo period, Kanazawa was the <b>capital of Kaga Domain</b>. The Kaga Domain was the biggest domain in the period expect Tokugawa Shogunate, and Kanazawa was the <b>4th largest city</b> in Japan. (1. Edo, 2.Osaka, 3.Kyoto, 4.Kanazawa, 5.Nagoya) <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Kaga Domain wasn’t originally compatible with Tokugawa Shogunate before the Edo period, and they needed to avoid to be seen as dangerous from Tokugawa. So, they didn’t use ample funds for military, in contrast, they used it for <b>art</b> and <b>culture</b>. For example, the scale of Kanazawa castle is not big considering the scale of Kaga Domain, but the castle is very beautiful and interesting. The variety of Ishigaki, stone wall, is most numerous in Japanese castles, and they are not only for defense, but also for art. <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please enjoy Kanazawa luxuriant traditional culture!
