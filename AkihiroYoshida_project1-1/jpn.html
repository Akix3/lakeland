						HISTORY
					</h3>
					<p>
						<b>The first style</b> of Shinjyuku Gyoen garden was only Japanese traditional style. In the <b>Edo era</b>, this site was owned by a <b>“daimyo”</b> (feudal lord, Naito clan). He constructed this garden centered around Tamamo Pond. Up to the present time, there are many difficulties, but this garden has been preserved by a lot of efforts and made better and better.

						Tamamo Pond
					</h4>
					<p>
						Tamamo Pond is the first garden made in this site, so it can be called the <b>origin</b> of Shinjyuku Gyoen. There are beautiful Japanese style <b>pond</b>, <b>bridge</b>, <b>stone-lantern</b>, and <b>plants</b>. Sometimes you can see cute <b>fishes</b> and <b>birds</b> in the pond! In addition, behind this garden, there are many skyscrappers. The collaboration of traditional Japanese Garden and morderm bulidings is very cool.

						There are many Japanese plants. You can see noble <b>pine trees</b> at all seasons. However,  the best season is <b>spring</b>. In early spring, you can see <b>plum blossoms</b> (Ume, in Japnese), and in late spring, you can see <b>cherry blossomes</b> (Sakura, in Japanese). The soft pastel pink is one of the colors which represent Japan.
